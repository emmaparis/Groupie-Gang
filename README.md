## Description
Our sleek, mobile-first app lets you search for a musical artist to get back a curated list of concerts with venue, city, country, date, an image of the artist, and a made-to-order generated map showing the exact location of the concert. 

This project features the Bulma CSS framework,  vanilla javascript and jQuery, google fonts api, the js swiper library, rapidAPI's artist-concert api, mapbox's static map-generating api, and some hard work from the students who created it.
